I was a healthy, very active guy who was biking around 50 miles a week, hiking 5-10 miles, sometimes more.  I ate well, was (and still am) thin, and have never smoked.  Now, some days I can barely make it up a flight of stairs without needing to stop and take a breath.  I feel like I'm going to faint if I move too quickly.

What happened?  My doctors say it's Fibromyalgia, a "syndrome" that affects 3-4% of the population, 90% of whom are women.  It causes chronic, widespread pain, as well as significant fatigue.  Some days, I'm fine.  Other times, like today, I can barely move.  If I get up too quickly, I black out.  I can take about 4 stairs at a time before I need to pause for a minute.  Sometimes, these "flare-ups" last for days, or even weeks.

I have medication that helps with pain, but nothing really helps the fatigue - trust me, I've tried just about everything.  I'm still able to work because I have an amazing job that allows me to work from home whenever I need to, and I'm extremely thankful for that, because I can't imagine being stuck at home without being able to keep doing something that I'm passionate about.

Some days, I wallow in self-pity, wishing that this hadn't happened to me, but things could be much worse, so in the end, I'm thankful.  I can still walk.  I still have good days where I'm able to take a hike or a 15-mile bike ride.  I have a wonderful job, and a wife who loves me very much.  Lydia does a lot for me.  She picks up the slack that I leave when I'm not able to get up and do much.

Most importantly, I still have my faith in God.  Sometimes I lose focus on that faith, but without Him, I wouldn't have much to live for.  I would be empty and lost.
